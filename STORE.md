# Store metadata

Starter file generated from this template's manifest. Every store asks
for this material at submission time; keep it current as the code
changes instead of rewriting it at the end. Replace the placeholder
lines marked TODO before you submit.

Packaging your extension is local and free. Submitting the result to a
store is what [extension.dev](https://docs.extension.dev/publish/overview?utm_source=store-md)
does, and it sponsors Extension.js.

## Listing

- Name: prompt-pad
- Summary: Shows a Svelte overlay on web pages, with an options page
  that moves it from right to left.
- Description: TODO write two or three short paragraphs of user
  benefits. Describe what the user sees and gains, not how the code
  works.
- Category: TODO pick one per store (for example Productivity).
- Screenshots: TODO at least one 1280x800 screenshot per store.

## Privacy and data use

- This template stores one setting, which edge the overlay sits on,
  in the browser's own sync storage. It collects and transmits no user
  data.
- The manifest declares data_collection_permissions: none for
  Firefox, which matches this behavior. If you add data collection,
  update the declaration, this section, and your privacy policy in
  the same change.
- Privacy policy URL: TODO required by every store once you collect
  any data.

## Chrome Web Store

### Single purpose

Shows a Svelte overlay on web pages, with an options page that moves
it from right to left.

### Permissions justification

- Content script match <all_urls>: The content script runs on the pages the user visits to render the extension's on-page interface. Narrow this to the specific sites your extension needs before submitting.
- storage: keeps the one setting the options page writes, so the
  choice survives closing the page and restarting the browser. The
  content script reads the same key to decide which edge the overlay
  sits on. Nothing leaves the browser.

## Firefox Add-ons

### Reviewer notes

TODO steps a reviewer needs to exercise the extension, plus test
credentials if sign-in is required. Start by opening any page, then
click Open options on the overlay and tick the setting to watch the
overlay move to the left edge. The build is bundled, so AMO requires a
source zip. Include build-from-source instructions: npm install, then
npm run build. The dist output matches the upload.

### Release notes

TODO user-facing notes for the version you are submitting.

## Edge Add-ons

### Certification notes

TODO anything the certification team needs to test the extension,
including test steps and credentials. Mirrors the Firefox reviewer
notes in most cases.

## Version history

- 1.0.0 (unreleased): initial version from the content-svelte template.
